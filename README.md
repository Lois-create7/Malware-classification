# Malware-classification
This is a malware classification program. Taking in big data such as files and putting them in their corresponding categories. 
The proposed method relies on feature selection and extraction. 
Specifically the feature selection being that of opcodes, and the extraction being that of the opcode frequencies in each malware file. 
For the evaluation, the proposed method was applied to the dataset from Microsoft, which aided in the malware classification challenge in 2015.
This dataset is half a terabyte uncompressed and consists of 9 different malware families, all categorized according to their id number. 
The proposed method takes into account these malware families, and strives to correctly classify them according to their opcode frequencies. 
The aim of this classification is to provide a method to correctly and without bias, classify malware in big data.
